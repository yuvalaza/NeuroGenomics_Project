## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Part 1**: Grasping Molecular Mechanisms of Neurological Diseases 🧩
  - Unravel the intricate connection between a specific mutated gene and its physiological implications in a neurological disorder.
  - Analyze raw sequencing data from mouse models to gain insights into the molecular deficiencies linked with the gene knockout.
  - Discover potential treatment pathways based on the molecular findings.

- **Part 2**: Dissecting Single Cell Sequencing in Breast Cancer Biopsy 🌌
  - Harness the potential of in situ sequencing to unveil the therapeutic relevance of immunotherapy in breast cancer patients.
  - Classify cells, determine their types, and assess their spatial distributions to gauge the effectiveness of PD-L1 inhibitor drugs.

## 💡 Highlights 

- **Bulk Sequencing Analysis** 🧫: Process and analyze sequencing data from mouse cortex tissues, differentiating between control (C) and knockout (KO) models.
  
- **Single Cell Sequencing** 🦠: Delve into the world of breast cancer at the cellular level, determining the potential effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs based on genetic markers and spatial cell arrangements.

- **Software & Scripting** 💻: Utilize powerful bioinformatics tools like Kallisto, Salmon, Bowtie2, and DeSeq2. We also ensure clarity by justifying software choices and detailing every step with appropriate comments in the scripts.

## 🛠 Tools and Languages

- **Languages**: R
  
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Kallisto, Situ, and DeSeq2 🧬
