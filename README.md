## PART 2 - Analysis of Single-cell Sequencing In Situ

The goal of this part is to gain insights into the tissue's molecular characteristics and spatial organization.

### Steps

#### Preprocessing of Gene Expression Data: 
Loaded gene expression data into Seurat, followed by quality control, normalization, and scaling.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Conducted PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify principal components capturing major variations.

#### k-NN Clustering:
Applied k-NN clustering to group cells based on gene expression profiles using principal components.

#### Differential Expression Analysis:
Conducted post-clustering differential expression analysis to identify significant patterns and marker genes.


### Code & Results

### Conclusions for Part 2
